	This is the outline for how the join page would work. The users input their information and it is then stored into tables. With this code we can get users contacts and sort them by their preferences for a more personal connection later on in the app. This has a very rough sql database, it works and stores the information but it could definitely be cleaned up. Later on the app could use their preferences to give them the best experience. One major thing that needs to be done is assigning all of the users information to their specific email, allowing them to sign back in to their aorio account.
