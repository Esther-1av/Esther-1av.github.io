	This is the code for storing users information and a extremely basic web page. The users input their information and it is then stored into tables. With this code we can get users contacts and sort them by their preferences and information for a more personal connection later on in the app. I have cleaned up and organized the sql database so that it is easy to filter information. Later on the app could use their preferences to give them the best experience. One major thing that needs to be done is making it so users are able to sign back in to their Inke account using the stored email.
